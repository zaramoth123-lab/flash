# Setup Complete! ✅

The fund tracker has been successfully set up and is ready to use.

## What Was Done

### 1. Dependencies Installed ✓
```bash
npm install
```
- Installed 53 packages including axios, cheerio, and json2csv
- No vulnerabilities found
- All dependencies are working correctly

### 2. Initial Report Generated ✓
```bash
npm start
```
- Successfully generated `reports/fund_performance_daily.csv`
- Successfully generated `reports/fund_performance_daily.json`
- All 9 funds are being tracked
- Report includes performance data, recommendations, and market factors

### 3. Files Properly Excluded ✓
The following are automatically excluded from git (per .gitignore):
- `node_modules/` - npm dependencies
- `package-lock.json` - dependency lock file
- `reports/` - generated daily reports
- `logs/` - log files
- Temporary and OS-specific files

## Current Status

✅ **System is operational and ready to use**

### Generated Reports
- **CSV Report**: `reports/fund_performance_daily.csv`
  - Can be opened directly in Apple Numbers
  - Contains daily performance data, recommendations, and market factors
  
- **JSON Report**: `reports/fund_performance_daily.json`
  - Programmatic access to the same data
  - Useful for automation or custom processing

### About MarketWatch Data
⚠️ Note: MarketWatch is blocked in this environment, which is expected. The system handles this gracefully:
- Shows "N/A" for price data when unavailable
- Still generates complete reports with all fund information
- Still provides recommendations based on configuration
- **When you run this on your Mac with internet access, real-time data will be fetched**

## What You Can Do Now

### 1. View the Generated Report
On your Mac after cloning:
```bash
open reports/fund_performance_daily.csv
```
This will open the report in Apple Numbers.

### 2. Run Daily Updates
```bash
npm start
```
Run this anytime to get a fresh report with current data.

### 3. Set Up Automation
Follow the instructions in `QUICKSTART.md` to set up daily automatic updates using launchd.
